upon a time, in a time far, far, away…\n\nThis is the beginning of something new and unique, something I hope to show you folks one evening of the year: the time of season 3 will officially (and by the way, before you ask, we don't have a set date for it yet) be titled \"The Next Step.\" What that actually means, I have no idea. What I do know is that the creative team and I believe it's a great time to bring a new entry to the long-running show, and it will take place on the same night as season 2 (but will take place in a much different time period). We were talking about this a bit recently and we both feel it's a very different time period than the first three seasons with a lot of other variables such as the fact that the show is the same age and there just aren't as many of the main characters to worry about. We were also talking a little bit about a few of our favourite moments in the first three seasons because they definitely take place out in the time periods we're working in. In other words, it's all about the characters and the story we're telling. The main storyline is very much about these characters but we had\n\nOnce upon a time, it didn't change, and now it seems this is more than a passing fad (the \"trend\" is an over-the-top fad) and should not be allowed to change the rules in the future, especially since the future can be defined by how far this particular trend goes. As an example of the hypocrisy we are dealing with, a few months ago when the NFL first passed a policy on domestic violence to allow only the NFLPA to enforce the policy, other professional sports leagues — especially soccer and boxing — were extremely vocal in urging the NFL not \"let the NFLPA decide what is legal and unfair.\" After all, the NFLPA's current policy is clearly a \"trend\" in the NFL, and the other leagues are not going to stand in the way of it.\n\nHowever, we should note that the NFL, at the end of the day, would only follow suit with the US Soccer Federation if the USSF were to adopt this exact same policy of enforcing no contact against every player whose actions result in a red card. If, in fact, US Soccer were to adopt this policy, players like David Villa, Ryan Nelsen, and Jermaine Jones would be subject to a suspension regardless of the\n\nOnce upon a time, I had some of the best grades I'd ever had.\n\nAnd then one day, on the first day of school, I got a note from my English teacher, telling me I had made it through the first day of class without a single F grade.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\nThe teacher explained that I had been testing out of my English classes, and was only going to take my social studies and history classes for the rest of the semester.\n\nMy English teacher explained that I had been testing out of my English classes, and was only going to take my social studies and history classes for the rest of the semester.\n\nShe explained to me in the most level-headed manner that I was doing well, that I was able to pay attention, and that there was much for me to learn. And that made me wonder: Was education that important?\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\nWhat if no one knew anything? What if you just ended up drowning in your own ignorance? What if all the best educators were just being dumb?\n\nAs a kid with a fairly mediocre intellect, I was very susceptible to this kind of attitude. Not because I believed it at the time—but because I thought my teachers were dumb, and so\n\nOnce upon a time, you could get a license to hunt deer in Wisconsin if you were over 21 and had made a decent-sized deposit on the property.\n\nNowadays, if you want to have deer shoot at you you have to be a hunter's license applicant or buy one at gun shows and at some wildlife management districts. Hunters in Wisconsin generally must have a hunting rifle or shotgun and four shots on target to be able to hunt deer.\n\nWhat about a deer suppressor?\n\nWisconsin does not have a deer hunting suppressor law. However, the state's Fish and Wildlife Board has a statement of policy that they will only enforce the existing suppressor law that is in effect.\n\nOnce upon a time, it used to make sense to put some distance between your web browser and websites that you wanted it to access.\n\nWeb browsers, both desktop and mobile, evolved from tiny desktop-oriented software that used to be a part of desktop computers to full-blown applications that were meant to be used on a touchscreen. To use Windows or Mac software, you would need to download it and navigate your way around the apps within the user interface.\n\nHowever, as touch devices like smartphones took off, web browsers began to disappear at a faster and faster rate. Chrome, for instance, made a huge leap this week to officially offer a native touch mode of its browser.\n\nMany users are likely unaware that their web browsing histories are stored on Google's servers.\n\nThe company offers to sell information gleaned from this data to third-parties, particularly advertisers. The information is sold on a \"use by\" basis, meaning that certain companies and groups can use it to show ads that you either click on or avoid.\n\nSo far, it's unclear how much information Google actually collects from its users — the company typically doesn't disclose the number of people who use its products — but several privacy advocates believe that Google is more than willing\n\nOnce upon a time, we all had the same dream — be the president of the United States. Since our nation was founded, many of us have worked tirelessly to achieve that most humbling and inspiring of feats.\n\nAt least for us, a man and wife and a handful of family members have the opportunity to do it all over again in a few years, but that dream may be dead if Donald Trump is elected the next president of the United States.\n\nThe election of Trump would be a serious threat to democracy, the fabric of American life and our right to vote. It could make it impossible for America to advance as a \"people's democracy.\"\n\nThe consequences of a Trump presidency will be seen in a number of ways: The presidency might be taken away from us. The office could be occupied by someone with extreme views. Government could look more and more like the Trump administration has in the two weeks since he won the election — even as Trump publicly denies such a transformation.\n\nAnd although there are those who say Trump cannot be president, it is unlikely that the man who is now president would be able to fulfill most of his campaign promises. There are some things that are impossible to govern — even during the honeymoon.\n\nHe would\n\nOnce upon a time, a young boy in the Middle East would dream that one day he would be King. Unfortunately, he would then have to wait his entire life for his chance to rule and he would eventually get sick, get old and die. That's why it is called a dream, but the truth is, it may never happen.\n\n\"We will all live in peace with each other: we cannot live in fear.\" – King Hussein of Jordan, as quoted in the Jerusalem Post, April 13, 1981, p. 1.\n\nIn the same vein, The National Prayer Breakfast will soon take place in Washington, where the United States President will deliver one-to-one address to the leaders of the Muslim world, all with the intent of \"coping with\" Muslims who have to face the wrath and hostility of the infidels. In this context, what is happening in the Middle East today will become a subject of study, since it is likely now that at least ten years from now, a few hundred million Muslims will live in the United States, and we will all live in peace with each other.\n\nLet us, however, begin with a little bit of history.\n\nThis is how the great Islamic Caliphs spent\n\nOnce upon a time, the main way to get your hands on these things was simply to buy the pre-production discs in the shops, and the discs themselves would be released on CD. If you missed out on the DVDs, they were readily available in the shops. With most people now watching movies online, the only way these discs can be obtained is to trade and eBay. All the Blu-ray discs of the film have been available for the best part of a month now.\n\nGiven the nature of the Blu-ray format, it's unsurprising that you're still not seeing a lot in the way of reviews of the film, which has been met more with a mixture of excitement and skepticism than by anything else. You may have a lot of questions if you're new to this, but in general we think you can do your own research from sites such as Bluelight, IGN, etc, and find out a bit about the film ahead of time. All right, here's a breakdown of what we know about Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 so far…\n\nMain Cast\n\nChris Pratt (Star-Lord) aka Drax is playing a good guy in this sequel, voiced by Vin Diesel. Although he only makes a brief appearance in\n\nOnce upon a time, they were the big heroes of the franchise.\n\nIn the '80s, it was the Lakers. In the early '90s, it was the Celtics. Then, it got a lot darker: the Sixers. The only problem was that for years, the franchise remained a bit of a weirdo for fans of other teams, who never really had much love for the Philadelphia sports scene.\n\nHere's how the whole thing started back in the late 1970s, when the ABA was launched and the city was left with no other choice but to build a new stadium to stay on the map. One of the first steps taken was a deal with the city of Philadelphia to build the Spectrum, a new facility to house two Wahlbergs, a Breslin Bros, and a few others on one floor. And while it would eventually be renamed from the Wells Fargo Center to the Wells Fargo Center, it would remain the city's minor league arena, the city, and fans of a couple of minor league teams.\n\nThen the whole thing went sideways. To say the Sixers were on the outs would be an understatement. The franchise wasn't even playing out its lease on that new facility at the time, so a bunch of\n\nOnce upon a time, an ordinary little dog was so much more capable of being treated as a human being by society and especially the law than today's pit bulls and Rottweilers are, and as such their lives are not given that same value,\" said attorney Gary E. Kreisman. \"And no wonder, because no one in this community wants to be remembered as the man who killed a Pit Bull.\"\n\nKreisman represented Darlene K. Hinkle and Robert R. Tait Jr. in their civil suit against an Ohio pit bull breeder, Michael R. Zieglers, for their deaths.\n\nThe lawsuit has been dismissed.\n\nThe case is T.R. and L.R. v. ZG.\n\nKREISMAN'S PORTRAIT IN CRISIS\n\nAccording to Kreisman, Rottweilers and Pit Bulls have a reputation for attacking people. In fact, Rottweilers were involved in 33 attacks in the past two months alone, Kreisman said.\n\nKreisman described his client's injuries in graphic fashion. The attorney showed a photo of a dog that has already been euthanized. The man's neck has been broken, Kreisman said, and\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"predictions = tokenizer.batch_decode(outputs, skip_special_tokens=True)\nresults = perplexity.compute(predictions=predictions, batch_size=16, model_id='gpt2-large', device=\"cuda\")\nprint('mean_perplexity:', results['mean_perplexity'])","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-12-04T01:46:08.985442Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-12-04T01:46:08.985819Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-12-04T01:46:23.600124Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-12-04T01:46:08.985783Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-12-04T01:46:23.599218Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":13,"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"  0%|          | 0/2 [00:00<?, ?it/s]","application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"version_major":2,"version_minor":0,"model_id":"e6661e39ec4941e6b8faa7235f748517"}},"metadata":{}},{"name":"stdout","text":"mean_perplexity: 10.452028013765812\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# My Boutique LM Evaluation","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"!git clone https://github.com/yaraksen/murky_lm.git\n%cd murky_lm","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-12-04T01:52:56.989436Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-12-04T01:52:56.990372Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-12-04T01:52:59.209804Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-12-04T01:52:56.990336Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-12-04T01:52:59.208700Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":2,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"Cloning into 'murky_lm'...\nremote: Enumerating objects: 61, done.\u001b[K\nremote: Counting objects: 100% (61/61), done.\u001b[K\nremote: Compressing objects: 100% (43/43), done.\u001b[K\nremote: Total 61 (delta 34), reused 45 (delta 18), pack-reused 0\u001b[K\nReceiving objects: 100% (61/61), 206.40 KiB | 1.38 MiB/s, done.\nResolving deltas: 100% (34/34), done.\n/kaggle/working/murky_lm\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"!git pull origin","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-12-04T01:57:05.057839Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-12-04T01:57:05.058718Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-12-04T01:57:07.095894Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-12-04T01:57:05.058685Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-12-04T01:57:07.094702Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":8,"outputs":[{"name":"stderr","text":"huggingface/tokenizers: The current process just got forked, after parallelism has already been used.

She loved to play outside in the snow. One day, she saw her friend Timmy walking by. \"Hi Timmy!\" Lily said. \"Hi Lily!\" Timmy replied. Lily noticed that Timmy was wearing a white hat. \"Why are you wearing that hat?\" she asked. \"I'm wearing it to keep my head warm,\" Timmy said. Lily thought that was cool. She started to lick her lips because it was so warm. \"Your lips are so cold yuck,\" she complained. Timmy laughed. \"It's not woofing, silly!\" he said. Lily and Timmy played together in the snow, making snow angels and having snowball fights. They had so much fun together.\n\nOne day in the evening there was a little girl called Daisy. Daisy was three and her name was Lucy. Daisy was in the park playing with her friends when suddenly a loud rumble filled the air. It was thunder! Daisy and her friends were scared and they all started running away. Daisy saw a beautiful butterfly flying close to them. She tried to catch it, but it was too fast for her. Suddenly a voice called out, \"Do not be scared, Daisy!\" It was Daisy's mom. \"It was just thunder and lightning, Daisy. Don't worry, it won't scare you\". Daisy's mom knew that Daisy was harmless and she was always there to help her. She smiled at Daisy, kissed her forehead and said, \"Have fun again\". Daisy and her friends ran back to play and were happy that Daisy wasn't scared. She even forgot what the fear of thunder was.\n\nOne day, a little girl named Mia was playing outside. She saw a tiny insect. The insect was so small but very useful. It could fly and help Mia with her family. Mia was very nice, so she said, \"Good job, little insect! I like you.\" The insect liked Mia. They became friends, and Mia dared to play with it. They played a game of catch. Mia would throw a ball and the insect would fly. They laughed and had lots of fun. One day, it was time for Mia to go inside. She said to the insect, \"Please come in and stay with me.\" The insect felt sad.
